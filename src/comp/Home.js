            What is our species going to do when 
            the healing power of technology becomes 
            a danger?…ROUND WENT THE WHEEL, a poetic 
            new play by Frank Ceruzzi, [delves] into 
            the enduring question of why being human 
            is a reward in itself….This stuff of graphic 
            novels and anime is now on stage thanks to 
            the Broadway Bound Festival. Director Janet 
            Bentley elicits some remarkable performances 
            from the multi-generational cast. You might be
            able to visualize the younger actors Gilman 
            and Elgrabli leading a revolution.
